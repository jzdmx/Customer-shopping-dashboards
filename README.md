# Customer-shopping-dashboards
Welcome to the Istanbul Shopping Data Analysis Project! Our dataset includes shopping information collected from 10 diverse shopping malls during the period of 2021 to 2023. Our project aims to uncover valuable insights into customers' shopping patterns and identify key trends over time. We will analyze the data using various statistical and machine-learning techniques to provide a comprehensive view of the shopping behavior of customers. In addition, we will develop an interactive dashboard using PowerBI to present our findings visually. Join us on this exciting journey of discovering new perspectives on shopping in Istanbul!

The dataset can be found on Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mehmettahiraslan/customer-shopping-dataset).
It contains the following information such as invoice numbers, customer IDs, age, gender, payment methods, product categories, quantity, price, order dates, and shopping mall locations. 


Ps. The project is still under construction so will be updated later!
